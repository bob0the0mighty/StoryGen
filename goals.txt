CPSC 599 â€“ Generating Programming Assignments using Story Generation Techniques.  

High Level Goals - 
	Review Literature
		On Automatic Programming Assignments
			Noah Ryan's paper
			Generation of Problems, Answers, Grade and Feedback - Kumar 
        Believes semantic problems are better represented by template-like systems and
        syntactic problems better represented with randomly generated system. Also states 
        that semantic problems are domain-dependant and thus not reusable, for different 
        languages I assume, but are composable with one another.

      Automated Generation of Randomized java programming assignments from abstract 
      descriptions - Smith
        
				S.H. Edwards et al:Developing a Common Format for Sharing Programming Assignments
          tangentially related to current goal.  Describes a format similar to jars for 
          programming assignments.
		On Story Generation
			Natural Language processing 
				OpenNLP - opennlp.apache.org - Apache run Natural Language Processing 
					project.  Java based with bindings to other systems.

				Protege - ontology editor - 
					may be useful for building corpus from which sensical stories can be created.
