			Generation of Problems, Answers, Grade and Feedback - Kumar 
        Believes semantic problems are better represented by template-like systems and
        syntatic problems better represented with randomly generated system. Also states 
        that semantic problems are domain-dependant and thus not reusable, for different 
        languages I assume, but are composable.

      descriptions - Smith
        
				S.H. Edwards et al:Developing a Common Format for Sharing Programming Assignments
          tangentally related to current goal.  Describes a format similar to jars for 
          programming assignments.
